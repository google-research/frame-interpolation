"""A library for instantiating the model for training frame interpolation.

All models are expected to use three inputs: input image batches 'x0' and 'x1'
and 'time', the fractional time where the output should be generated.

The models are expected to output the prediction as a dictionary that contains
at least the predicted image batch as 'image' plus optional data for debug,
analysis or custom losses.
